RCift is a interpreter for my new programming language Cift.

As you can see, the interpreter is mostly Rust which is why the interpreter is named RCift for "Rust Cift Interpreter."

Cift got its name from my admiration of C# and Java like syntax with static type declaration.
The -ift part pf Cift got its name for its purpose of being fast or swift. (Noting to do with apple's replacement for objective-c)
